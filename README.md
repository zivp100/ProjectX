 Geocoding Proxy Service

This project is a simple network service that can resolve the lat, lng coordinates for an address
by using third party geocoding services. The service should provide a RESTful HTTP interface and
use JSON for data serialization.

The service implements two different third party geocoding services. It has a primary service and additional backup services used for each request.
