 Geocoding Proxy Service

This project is a simple network service that can resolve the <lat, lng> coordinates for an address
by using third party geocoding services. The service provides a RESTful HTTP interface.

The service implements two different third party geocoding services. It has a primary service and additional backup services used for each request.
